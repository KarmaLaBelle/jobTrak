# jobTrak
---
## What is it?
* Right now? Nothing. But one day, it will be a Rails app that will allow small businesses to track employees and for those employees to receive news about customers to visit, etc.
* My first Rails app, and my first web app in general

## Why is *THIS* your first project?

Because it seemed like something fun, and I know of a couple businesses in my area that could use something like this

## How can I help?

I dunno. You decide.
